    <h1>hi, i'm russell</h1>

    <p>
      I've been programming for a while — from a <a href="https://betterworld.mit.edu/meet-the-makers-russell-pasetes-20/">music tech startup at MIT</a> to <a href="https://dmrpacific.com/">government software</a> on the <a href="https://www.visitguam.com/about-guam/">beautiful island territory</a> of <a href="https://www.guampedia.com/">Guam</a>, where I leveraged large language models before most people trusted them. But I kept hitting the same wall: the folks back home couldn't hear the wave that was coming, and I didn't have the words to explain why. So I traveled the world to figure that out — studying the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164515.Orality_and_Literacy">invention</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48582.The_Spell_of_the_Sensuous">inheritance</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/211076323-the-knowledge-gene">integrity</a> of language itself. Eventually arrived at the <a href="https://fractalbootcamp.com/">Fractal Bootcamp</a> in Williamsburg, NYC to stop theorizing and start building. I'm looking to work with people who are surfing what's already here by crafting tools that help people make more sense of life and remember what matters.
